## Example: Aim Trainer Tester App

To demonstrate and test the universal overlay/injection system, we created a standalone FPS Aim Trainer app:

- **AimTrainer.exe**: A Raylib-powered FPS aim trainer that spawns targets, tracks user input, and exposes memory anchors for overlay scanning.
- The overlay DLL and injector work with AimTrainer exactly as they would with any other game—no code changes required.
- All key events (initialization, target spawn, anchor creation) are logged to `bin/debug.log`.
- This tester app validates the universal workflow and integration for any game.

## DLL Injection Methods

**SetWindowsHookEx Injection**
- Utilizes the Windows API to install a hook procedure into the target game process, allowing the DLL to be loaded automatically when specific system events occur (e.g., keyboard, mouse, or window messages).
- This method is stealthy and compatible with many games, as it leverages legitimate OS mechanisms.
- Once injected, the DLL can access the game’s memory space, read relevant data (such as enemy positions), and write results to shared memory or named pipes for use by external overlays.
- Ideal for overlays, input interception, and lightweight integrations where minimal disruption to the game process is required.

**Manual DLL Injection**
- Directly injects the DLL into the target process using `CreateRemoteThread` and `LoadLibrary`.
- The injector opens the game process, allocates memory for the DLL path, writes the path, and creates a remote thread to load the DLL.
- This method is fast, reliable, and works with most Windows games, but typically requires administrator privileges due to process access rights.
- Preferred for development, debugging, and scenarios where full control over the injection process is needed.

**Process Hollowing / Code Cave**
- An advanced technique where the injector replaces or augments the code of a running process with custom code or DLL entry points.
- The original process is started in a suspended state, its memory is modified to inject the desired code, and then resumed.
- Enables deep integration, custom loaders, and anti-detection strategies, but is more complex and riskier than standard injection methods.
- Used in security research, advanced overlays, and scenarios requiring complete control over process execution.

## Architecture Overview

**Your Game Process:**
```
├── Original Game Code (untouched)
├── Injected DLL
│   ├── Scans and reads game memory for real-time data (e.g., enemy positions, player stats)
│   ├── Communicates with external modules via shared memory or named pipes
│   └── Maintains a minimal footprint, ensuring no modification to game logic or assets
```

**External Overlay Process:**
```
├── Overlay/Assist/Analytics System (completely separate from the game)
├── Reads live target and game data from shared communication channels
├── Renders overlays, applies aim assist, or performs analytics based on real game state
└── Can be updated, extended, or distributed independently of the game
```

---

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Zero source code changes to your game**: No need to modify, patch, or recompile the game itself. All integration is external and non-invasive.
- **Full autonomy with zero hardcoding**: System automatically detects, configures, and adapts to any game without manual intervention or hardcoded values.
- **High precision**: Direct access to in-memory game data (such as enemy coordinates, player stats, etc.) enables accurate overlays and assist features.
- **Real-time data**: Memory scanning and IPC provide instant access to game state, eliminating the lag and inaccuracies of screen capture or input polling.
- **Completely external**: The overlay, aim assist, and analytics modules are developed and maintained separately, allowing for rapid iteration and easy updates.
- **Investor-friendly**: No exposure or redistribution of proprietary game code. The system is safe for demonstration, review, and deployment in professional environments.
- **Universal compatibility**: The architecture supports any Windows game, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases beyond aim training (e.g., analytics, accessibility, custom overlays).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (with submodules):
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/elliotttmiller/ai_aim.git
   ```
2. **Configure and build** using CMake or Visual Studio 2022:
   - All build outputs are placed in `bin/Debug/`
   - Use the root `CMakeLists.txt` for full project build
   - Individual modules can be built separately if needed
3. **Run `Launcher.exe`** from `bin/Debug/` to start the full workflow
4. **Check `bin/debug.log`** for unified debug output and diagnostics
5. **Note**: AimTrainer test app currently requires build configuration fixes

## Contributing & Extending

- The project is modular—new overlays, aim assist algorithms, or IPC methods can be added easily.
- All code is organized for clarity and maintainability, with robust error handling and logging.
- See each module's source files for further documentation and extension points.
