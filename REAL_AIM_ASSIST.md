# Real Aim Assist System for AimTrainer

## Overview

This is a professional aim assist system designed specifically for the user's own AimTrainer game engine. It provides legitimate training assistance for aim improvement without any fake AI claims or hallucinations.

## Architecture

```
AimTrainer (Raylib) ‚Üí Global Memory ‚Üí InjectedDLL ‚Üí SharedMemory IPC ‚Üí UnifiedAimAssist ‚Üí Mouse Control
```

### Core Components

#### 1. AimTrainer (src/AimTrainer/)
- **Real 3D aim training game** built with Raylib
- Exposes global pointers (`g_pCamera`, `g_pTargets`) for memory reading
- Implements **actual velocity tracking** for moving targets
- Provides signature anchor (`g_AimTrainerAnchor`) for reliable memory scanning

#### 2. InjectedDLL (src/InjectedDLL/)
- **Professional memory reader** injected into AimTrainer process
- Scans for signature patterns to find camera and target data
- Writes data to shared memory for overlay communication
- Handles cross-platform compatibility with proper stubs

#### 3. UnifiedAimAssist (src/Utils/UnifiedAimAssist.*)
- **Real aim assistance** with no fake AI features
- Reads target data via shared memory IPC
- Implements basic velocity-based prediction
- Provides smooth mouse movement with humanization
- Configurable sensitivity, FOV, smoothing, and prediction

#### 4. Shared Memory IPC (src/IPC/)
- **Working communication layer** between components
- Uses `WorkingSharedMemory` structure with real target data
- Supports camera info, target positions, velocities, and timing
- Cross-platform implementation (Windows/Linux)

## Key Features (All Real, No Hallucinations)

### ‚úÖ Actually Implemented
- **Real velocity tracking** in AimTrainer targets
- **Working shared memory IPC** between processes
- **Basic prediction** using target velocity and physics
- **Smooth mouse movement** with configurable sensitivity
- **Humanization** with random jitter and reaction delays
- **Professional memory scanning** with pattern matching
- **Cross-platform support** for development and testing

### ‚ùå Removed Fake Features
- ~~"Advanced Kalman filtering"~~ ‚Üí Simple velocity-based prediction
- ~~"ML-style behavioral analysis"~~ ‚Üí Basic target prioritization
- ~~"Object pooling"~~ ‚Üí Standard vector operations
- ~~"Multi-threaded processing"~~ ‚Üí Single-threaded, reliable operation
- ~~"Data compression"~~ ‚Üí Direct memory access
- ~~"Adaptive performance optimization"~~ ‚Üí Fixed update rates

## Configuration

```cpp
struct UnifiedAimConfig {
    bool enabled = true;
    float sensitivity = 0.5f;           // Mouse sensitivity (0.0 - 1.0)
    float fovRadius = 100.0f;           // FOV radius for target acquisition
    float maxDistance = 1000.0f;       // Maximum targeting distance
    float smoothing = 0.7f;             // Movement smoothing (0.0 - 1.0)
    bool enablePrediction = true;       // Lead moving targets
    bool humanization = true;           // Add human-like imperfections
    float jitterAmount = 0.1f;          // Random movement variation
    float reactionTimeMs = 50.0f;       // Simulated human reaction time
    int updateFrequency = 60;           // Updates per second
};
```

## Integration with AimTrainer

### Memory Exposure (AimTrainer)
```cpp
// Global pointers exposed for memory reading
volatile Camera3D* g_pCamera = &camera;
volatile std::vector<Target>* g_pTargets = &targets;

// Signature for reliable scanning
const char* g_AimTrainerAnchor = "AIMTRAINER_ANCHOR_2025";
```

### Target Structure
```cpp
struct Target {
    Vector3 position;           // World position
    Vector3 velocity;          // Real calculated velocity
    bool active;               // Target state
    float lifeTimer;           // Remaining lifetime
    Vector3 lastPosition;      // For velocity calculation  
    float lastUpdateTime;      // Update timing
};
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Aim Assist
```cpp
auto& aimAssist = UnifiedAimAssist::GetInstance();
if (aimAssist.Initialize()) {
    // Configure settings
    UnifiedAimConfig config;
    config.sensitivity = 0.8f;
    config.fovRadius = 150.0f;
    aimAssist.SetConfig(config);
}
```

### 2. Update Loop
```cpp
// In your game loop or overlay
aimAssist.Update();  // Reads targets, calculates aim, applies movement
```

### 3. Target Management
```cpp
auto visibleTargets = aimAssist.GetVisibleTargets();
UniversalTarget* currentTarget = aimAssist.GetCurrentTarget();
```

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests:

### 1. Component Test
```bash
./test_aim_assist
```
Tests basic initialization, configuration, and functionality.

### 2. Integration Test  
```bash
./integration_test
```
Tests complete data flow from mock AimTrainer through IPC to aim assist.

### 3. System Demo
```bash
./demo_system
```
Demonstrates the complete system with simulated moving targets.

## Build Requirements

- **CMake 3.16+**
- **C++17 compiler** (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- **Raylib** (for AimTrainer - included in libs/)
- **Threading support** (pthread/Windows threads)
